### Intro

If you never head of the [RealWord example apps](https://realworld.io) project you should check it out. The idea is pretty simple: build a complex enough app that folks can use as RealWorld reference?

*So what's the app people are building?* It's **Conduit**, a medium.com clone. If you visit the [RealWorld example apps](https://realworld.io) site you're gonna find some live demos.

Here what you will find is a walk-through on how to build a version of Conduit using [F#](https://fsharp.org) and [Fable](https://fable.io).

The goal is to build this application in a series of small, gentle and palatable lessons.

### What's F# and Fable

Here's a **TL;DR** explanation: F# is a functional programming language that runs of top .NET and Fable is a compiler powered by Babel that will compile F# code to JavaScript.

If you want more then that, I suggest you visit their sites [F#](https://fsharp.org) and [Fable](https://fable.io).

### Who's is this for?

This walk-through is target to folks who have experience with front-end development, probably some JavaScript. I will not assume you know any F# nor Fable. We're gonna walkthrough those together.
