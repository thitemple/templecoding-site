![Thiago Temple](/images/vintem.jpg){: .alignleft}**Thiago Temple**, brazilian, developer since I was 16.

I have always loved technology, my fascination by technology has begun when I used Lotus 123 and Wordstar, still in DOS, from them I started learning programing and I developed my first application using Basic.

I started Computer Science in 1999 and in the same year I began my first internship. Since, I have programmed using ASP, VB6 and after 2003 I almost always used .NET.

Although I did a lot of integrations between applications, my passion is really into web development. For the recent years I have built a lot of different applications using different technologies, like Rails, Java, PHP, and most recently I have been working with JavaScript and Node.JS.

I love to read, to watch movies and tv-shows and spent almost all the time listening to music, preferably Hip-Hop, Jazz and Rock, in that order.
