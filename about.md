My name is Thiago Temple, I'm Brazilian and living and working in Québec/Canada. Some of my friends also call me vintem, which is the handle I user for many things such as [my twitter](https://twitter.com/vintem12) and my [email](mailto:vintem@gmail.com).

Vintem doesn't mean much, is just a mix of my middle and last names.

## What I do
----
I work at [Emergensys](http://emergensys.net) as a developer and for most of the time I'm programming web related stuff.

## Why I do it
----
Even before my family bought its first computer back in the 90's I was already fascinated by them. I used to use my neighbour's computer when I was still 13. 

Today, I love the craft of writing software, and specially I love the challenge of being up to date with new technologies. I'm sure that the fact that technologies is constantly changing is one of the major things keeping motivated. That and the fact of knowing that people are becoming more productive because of software I'm helping build.

## What I do for fun
----
Living in Québec City with its hard winters made me discover a passion about board games. Now I love them, I have a somewhat growing collection. I also watch a few TV Shows, and I'm constantly reading at least one book.

But one thing I really love to do is to spend time with my family. I'm married, father of one little girl and two very active greyhounds.
