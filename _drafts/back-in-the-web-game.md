So, the last time a posted something on this blog it was almost two years ago. And, although I kept learning new things during this time, I didn't really felt like writing.

For one, I really took some (long) time to do some other things, for instance, I discovered a new hobby that I love: boardgaming.

But the main reason is because I have not been working (on my daily job) with web technologies. I've worked some time with BizTalk and for almost two years, with WPF.

I may not dislike WPF but I really don't enjoy it much either. So, from time to time, I wrote some pet projects to try and keep myself up to date with the new stuff on web technologies.
